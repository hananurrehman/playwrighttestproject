# Playwright Practice Project

This project demonstrates some basic learning I have acquired in Playwright:

## Contact List Demo App tests

The test web app I selected is

- https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/

The UI tests cover basic CRUD operations. Even though the app offers greater support for practice with APIs, I just felt that it's performance was not good enough for that.

After forking, execute the following command:

```bash
  npm install
```

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
  npx playwright test
```
